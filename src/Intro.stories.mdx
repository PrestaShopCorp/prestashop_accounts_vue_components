# What for?

This library provides VueJS components to integrate to the configuration page of
your module (in the PrestaShop backoffice) if you need to have a module linked to
PrestaShop Account). In this way, **the merchant will be able to link its PrestaShop
account to its shop** and then as a developer you will be able to access PrestaShop Billing services.

For a given shop that is not yet linked to PrestaShop Account, when the merchant want
to install / activate a module that uses PrestaShop Billing services, **the module configuration page
should show a connection box** before letting the module settings available, as this:

<Story id="components-connection-panels-account--not-connected" height='220px' />

This linking process **has to be done by the merchant only once for all modules**.
If the merchant already linked his shop from another module, then the component will look
like this:

<Story id="components-connection-panels-account--connected" height='230px' />

Once the merchant successfully linked his shop, the module should display its configuration
panel below this section, and you will be able to call PrestaShop Billing features.

# Integration

There is two ways to integrate the needed components. The first is the easier, and should be
sufficient for most of the cases: a unique component will manage display of different use cases.

## The easy way

Please see the PsAccount component, to integrate to your module page.

## Need a custom way?
