# What for?

This library provides VueJS components to integrate to the configuration page of
your module (in the PrestaShop backoffice). These components are needed if your
module uses PrestaShop Account authentication system.
With PrestaShop Account, we authenticate a shop with certainty and security.
From a merchant level, PrestaShop Account enables linking a user account to a shop,
thus authorizing a specific user account to manage the services for this shop.

For a given shop that is not yet linked to PrestaShop Account, when the merchant wants
to install / activate a module that uses PrestaShop account authentication system, **the
module configuration page should display a connection box** before letting the module
settings available, as this:

<Story id="components-panels-accountpanel--not-associated" height='175px' />

This linking process **has to be done by the merchant only once for all modules**.
If the merchant already linked his shop from another module, then the component will look
like this:

<Story id="components-panels-accountpanel--associated" height='175px' />

Once the merchant successfully linked his shop, the module should display its configuration
panel below this section.

# Integration

There are two ways to integrate the needed components. The first is the easiest one, and should be
sufficient for most cases: a unique component will manage the different status according to the context.

In both cases, you need to install the library as a Vue plugin in your VueJS bootstrap script:

```sh
npm install --save prestashop_accounts_vue_components
```

```javascript
import VueI18n from 'vue-i18n';
import psAccountsVueComponents from 'prestashop_accounts_vue_components';

Vue.use(VueI18n);
const i18n = new VueI18n({ ... });
Vue.use(psAccountsVueComponents);
psAccountsVueComponents.locale(i18n.locale); // you can also pass 'en', 'fr', 'it', ... directly!
```


## The easy way

Please see the [PsAccounts component documentation, to integrate to your module page](?path=/docs/integration-psaccounts-panel--connected#psaccounts-component-behavior).
This component will call every sub-components that is needed, and will display your own component
(in a VueJS slot) once the linking process is done.


## Need a custom way?

If the base case does not match your needs, you can instantiate each sub-component separately.
In this way, you will have to deal with missing pre-requisites cases, like:
- if the [PsAccounts module is not installed](?path=/docs/sub-components-alerts-alert-account-not-installed--not-installed),
- if the [PsAccounts module is not activated](?path=/docs/sub-components-alerts-alert-account-not-enabled--disabled),
- if the [multi-shop is activated](?path=/docs/integration-psaccounts-panel--multistore-selection),
- if the [merchant has no admin rights](?path=/docs/sub-components-panels-account--need-to-be-admin)

And then you can instantiate the [Account sub-component](?path=/docs/sub-components-panels-account--not-associated)
when these previous cases are managed.

# Javascript Helpers

In your frontend development, component integration is a first step, but your own components will need
some javascript helpers from PrestaShop Accounts.

```javascript
import { isOnboardingCompleted } from prestashop_accounts_vue_components;

const test = isOnboardingCompleted();
```
